<h1>Organizing Tasks with Issues</h1>
<p>It is important to stay organized when working collaboratively as it can easily become overwhelming when you have lots of branches and team members.</p>
<p>One tool that can help keep things on track is quantifying and prioritizing development tasks as Issues in GitHub.</p>
<p>To create Issues, navigate to the Issues tab (second from left in GitHub) and click the New Issue button.</p>
<p>Once an issue is created you can assign it to a specific team member, add notes, subscribe to get notifications when the issue is updated, and once the issue has been dealt with mark it as closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help keep the revision history clear, you can include the issue number in the commit message when committing changes or when merging branches.</p>
