<h1>Manual Version Control</h1>
<p>You've probably already been implementing a manual type of version control by saving files and/or folders with different names.</p>
<h3>Issues with Manual Version Control</h3>
<p>While it is better than no version control at all, it can be error prone.</p>
<p>It's easy to lose track of which version of a project has which changes.</p>
<p>As your projects become more complex and include ever greater numbers of files, manually tracking versions can become very tedious and time consuming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manual version control does not lend itself well to collaboration as changes from multiple team members, potentially working on the same files or assets, requires manual integration in the main project.</p>
