<h1>Git Branches</h1>
<p>With what we've covered so far you are able to track revisions of your project via commits and sync them between your local machine and the GitHub cloud with pull and push.&nbsp; This process is sufficient for incremental changes to your project, but when it comes time to make and manage significant changes or adding more substantial new features, you will want to get comfortable working with branches.</p>
<p>Branches allow us to make significant changes to our project, safely, outside the <strong>main&nbsp;</strong>branch.&nbsp; Once we are satisfied that the new feature is ready for production, we can then merge the "feature branch" back into the main branch.&nbsp; This allows for experimentation and a controlled, methodical, way to approach feature development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
