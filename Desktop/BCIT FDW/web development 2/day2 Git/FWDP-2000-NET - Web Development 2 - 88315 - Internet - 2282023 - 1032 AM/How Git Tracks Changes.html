<h1>How Git Tracks Changes</h1>
<p>Once you've initialized a project for Git, it can scan for new and edited <strong>files</strong> from that directory downwards and maintains an internal database (repository) of <strong>changes </strong>to those files.</p>
<p>To have it actually start tracking changes for any given file(s) in your project, you need to first&nbsp;<strong>add</strong> them to the repository.</p>
<p>Once added, you create point-in-time versions of those files by issuing the&nbsp;<strong>commit&nbsp;</strong>command along with a message indicating from a high level what has changed in that revision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can think of commits as a sort of snapshot of the state of your project at a point in time - somewhat like if you were manually tracking versions of your code by numbering them v1, v2, v3, etc.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike some other version control software, Git does not track folders themselves - just the files therein.&nbsp; For Git to be aware of a folder, you need to have at least one file within it.</p>
