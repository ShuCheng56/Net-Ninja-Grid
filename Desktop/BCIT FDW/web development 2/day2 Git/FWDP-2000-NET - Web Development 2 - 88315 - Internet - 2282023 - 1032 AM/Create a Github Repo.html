<h1>Create a GitHub Repo</h1>
<p>The core concept in working with GitHub and Git is that you'll have a remote version of your project stored on GitHub and a local version stored on your computer, and then you'll be syncing commits between the two.</p>
<p>If you've already got a project on your local machine you will want to "push" it GitHub (we'll cover that in a few slides).</p>
<p>If, however, you're starting a new project it is easier to create it on GitHub and then clone it to your local computer.</p>
<p>To create a GitHub repo, log in to GitHub on the web and click the "Start a Project" button.</p>
