<h1>GitHub</h1>
<p>Git and GitHub are two separate things.</p>
<p>Git is a version control system (software).</p>
<p>GitHub is a code hosting service (owned by Microsoft) that stores git repositories in the cloud.&nbsp; Having your repositories stored in the cloud is beneficial because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides redundancy if you lose the local version of your project</li>
<li>Provides access to your project from multiple machines</li>
<li>Allows multiple developers to easily work on the same project at the same time</li>
</ul>
<p>GitHub offers both free and paid accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Free accounts allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host unlimited public and private repositories</li>
<li>Public repositories can be viewed (but not edited) by anyone with a browser and an internet connection.
<ul>
<li>To edit a public repository, you must be the project owner or have invited another GitHub user(s) as a collaborator of the project</li>
<li>Public repositories are fine for open-source projects and class projects for education, but may not be appropriate for client work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Private repositories can only be viewed and edited by your team.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this program, a free account is all you need.</p>
