<h1>Committing Changes</h1>
<p>Once you've added your files (and instructed git which files and folders to ignore), you must <strong>commit</strong> them, including a message as to what has changed, to create a snapshot of that revision of your project.</p>
<p>Once you've performed a <strong>commit</strong> it is added to the version history of project and you can, if needed, revert your project to that point in time as well as compare what has changed between any two revisions.</p>
<p>To commit your changes, run the following command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git commit –m "Describe your changes"</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: Good commit messages are essential for maintaining version history, particularly if you need to revert to a previous commit.&nbsp;</strong></p>
