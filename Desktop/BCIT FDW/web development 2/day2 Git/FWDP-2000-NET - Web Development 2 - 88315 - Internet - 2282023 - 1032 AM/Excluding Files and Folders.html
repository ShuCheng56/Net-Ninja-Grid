<h1>Excluding Files and Folders</h1>
<p>There are various situation where you actually don't want git to track versions of certain files or folders within your project, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>system files created by your OS</li>
<li>node_modules folder
<ul>
<li>you'll learn about this when we get to React</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>computer generated files that are created/updated through a compile program&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>you'll learn about this when we get to Sass and Gulp</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can instruct git to ignore such files and folders by creating a simple text file, appropriately name .gitignore, in the root of your project.</p>
<p>Note to Mac users:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>By default MacOS hides files that begin with "."</li>
<li>To toggle the visibility of hidden files in Finder, press <code>cmd+shift+.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have created your .gitignore file, open it with a text editor and list them out, one per line, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore a single file
<ul>
<li>file-to-ignore.txt (or whatever file extension is appropriate)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ignore a directory
<ul>
<li>folder-name/</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use * as a wildcard to exclude groups of files, for instance the following would exclude all pdf files in a directory named resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>resources/*.pdf</li>
</ul>
<p>To add comments in your .gitignore file, start the line with #</p>
<p>The link below is to a reference .gitignore file that is a good starting point for web projects.&nbsp; Until you are using Sass or some other CSS preprocessor, you will want to comment out <strong>styles/</strong> on line 87</p>
