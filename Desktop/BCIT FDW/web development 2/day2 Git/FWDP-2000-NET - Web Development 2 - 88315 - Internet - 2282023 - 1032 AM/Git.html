<h1>Git - About</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Git is a&nbsp;<a href="http://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source">free and open source</a>&nbsp;distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for use in the development of Linux.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a></p>
<p>Git can be used via:</p>
<ul>
<li>The command line - entering text commands via the terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (windows)&nbsp;</li>
<li>through a GUI</li>
</ul>
<p>Though we'll take a look at both, I would encourage you to get comfortable with at least the basics of using git from the command line as that will often be the only choice when working on remote systems (via ssh).</p>
