<h1>Merging Branches</h1>
<p>When you're satisfied that your new or edited feature branch is ready for production, you will want to (carefully) merge it back into the main branch.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you are working solo on your project this process will look like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>commit all changes on your feature branch</li>
<li>switch to the main branch with:
<ul>
<li><code> git checkout main</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>merge the commits from your feature branch into main with:
<ul>
<li><code>git merge [feature branch name]&nbsp;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>push the complete repository to GitHub
<ul>
<li><code>git push</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If, however, you are working on a team and a review process would be more appropriate before integrating your new feature:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>commit all changes on your feature branch</li>
<li>push your feature branch to GitHub
<ul>
<li><code>git push origin [feature branch name]</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, on GitHub, issue a Pull Request indicating which branch is to be reviewed before being merged into main</li>
<li>Once your team is satisfied that your feature is approved, click Merge Pull Request, leave a comment as to what is being merged and finally, click Confirm Merge.</li>
<li>You may then choose to delete the feature branch (to keep things clean).</li>
</ul>
